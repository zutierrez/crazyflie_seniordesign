# EE175A/B Senior Design Project 

The objective of this project is to implement a system in ROS that optimally and dynamically allocates tasks to a swarm of 
5 Crazyflie 2.0 nano quadrotors and produces smooth trajectories for each quadrotor to follow to each task location in a 
Gazebo 3D simulated environment.

This repository contains the scripts for the multi-robot system, trajectory generation, and task allocation.
